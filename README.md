### **Prompt for Network Overview**

"Update the Bolt network documentation to reflect the following structure and tokenomics. Include clear explanations of how each component interacts and graphs illustrating the relationships and flow of funds within the ecosystem. Highlight how the network secures stable assets backed by future events. Details include:

#### **Tokenomics**  

1. **Funds Allocation (from events/packages)**:  
   - **20%**: Investors.  
   - **30%**: Developers.  
   - **10%**: Research & Development (R&D).  
   - **10%**: Split between Giveth, USDGLO, and Commons.  
   - Remaining: Distributed as outlined (RFV, NFV, Hand Protocol, Greenpill, Modal).  

2. **Revenue from Events**:  
   - **DAO Votes** on external event packages raised by partners (e.g., Greenpill, Hand Protocol).  
   - Modal Events operate directly under Modal with profits retained after network allocations.

#### **Graphs to Include**  

1. **Ecosystem Flow Diagram**  
   - Visualize how funds flow between Modal, RFV, NFV, Hand Protocol, Greenpill, and external DAOs.  

2. **Funds Allocation Pie Chart**  
   - Breakdown of how funds are distributed after events.  

3. **Revenue vs. Network Allocation**  
   - Graph showing how future events stabilize assets (backed by expected revenue).  

4. **Stakeholder Allocation**  
   - Show percentage allocation to Investors, Developers, R&D, and Public Goods (Giveth, USDGLO, Commons).

#### **Key Objectives**  

- Demonstrate the synergy between Modal, RFV, NFV, and Hand Protocol.
